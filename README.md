DOCS are a TODO

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/re-datagrid.svg)](https://clojars.org/re-datagrid)

## Development Mode

### Start Cider from Emacs:

Put this in your Emacs config file:

```
(setq cider-cljs-lein-repl
	"(do (require 'figwheel-sidecar.repl-api)
         (figwheel-sidecar.repl-api/start-figwheel!)
         (figwheel-sidecar.repl-api/cljs-repl))")
```

Navigate to a clojurescript file and start a figwheel REPL with `cider-jack-in-clojurescript` or (`C-c M-J`)

### Run application:

```
lein dev
```

Figwheel will automatically push cljs changes to the browser.

Wait a bit, then browse to [http://localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449).

### Run tests:

```
lein clean
lein doo phantom test once
```

The above command assumes that you have [phantomjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phantomjs) installed. However, please note that [doo](https://github.com/bensu/doo) can be configured to run cljs.test in many other JS environments (chrome, ie, safari, opera, slimer, node, rhino, or nashorn).

## Production Build


To compile clojurescript to javascript:

```
lein build
```
